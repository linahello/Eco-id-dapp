# Governance in Eco

There are two major governance processes in Eco, which run in parallel: community governance and monetary governance.

Сommunity governance begins with token-holder voting. All holders of ECO and ECOx are empowered to vote in community governance. Community governance controls all parameters of the Eco protocol. The system has the capacity to be fully upgradeable to accommodate various states of the future.

Community governance should not be used lightly; it can be used to change any parameter or process in the system, whether technical, economic or fiscal as the community decides. Given this power, the system starts by forcing community governance changes to pass a high bar: the support of 15% of all voting power is required to send a proposal to vote. From there, a simple majority of votes cast is required to execute the proposal.

While other decentralized cryptocurrencies either fix their monetary policies and allow exchange rate volatility, or try to limit volatility through excessive centralization risk, Eco achieves its goals through monetary policies transparently set and managed by a group of "Trustees" who are elected by the community of Eco holders. Their goal is to fulfill a single mandate: maximizing the aggregate wealth stored in the economy. The more successful ECO is as a currency, the more they’ve fulfilled their mandate. How the "Trustees" ultimately support that mandate is up to their discretion through the execution of monetary policy.
