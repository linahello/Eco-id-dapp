# Goals

Accessibility has two distinct meanings in a product context :

* the quality of being easily understood
* the quality of being easy to use.

Trying to optimize over one of those qualities might go in contradictions with the other :

* improving the quality of being easy to use by abstracting the complexity might result in lowering the quality of being easy to understand the inner system for its end users.
* improving the quality of being easily understood by breaking down the information flow might result in lowering the quality of being easy to use.

Each of these qualities is essential to fulfilling, but easy to prioritize due to the context this proposal lives in :

As the Eco Id protocols have been publicly released only a few weeks ago, there are only a few community members which fully understand how it works and what it has to offer. The priority is therefore to invest in education tools and material to increase the numbers of Eco ID advocates within the community.

The Eco ID playground ( MVP ) aim to be an education tool ( Dapp ), improving the accessibility of the Eco ID protocol by focusing over the quality of being easily understood.

The Eco ID Dapp (V1) aim to be improve the accessibility of the Eco ID protocol by focusing over the quality of being easy to use.

If the V1 will be developed from the MVP, the two versions will continue to be live and be developed independently as compare to what we can encounter in a traditional product life cycle.

The playground (MVP ) will be hosted on IPFS and not rely on centralized components, and therefore will stay and remain a fall back solution if the Eco id Dapp was to cease to function properly at any point of time.
