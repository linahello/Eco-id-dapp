# About Eco ID Playground

Eco ID Playground is an MVP version of the Eco ID Station, designed to facilitate interactions with Eco ID protocol, in a more playful, accessible, and educative way than calling the smart contract itself. \
Providing better accessibility to the Eco ID protocol is the key to fulfilling its growth and vision: to provide a fully decentralized and permissionless identity and reputation system that is simple, but maximally flexible. \


### Goals

Accessibility has two distinct meanings in a product context :

* the quality of being easily understood
* the quality of being easy to use.

Trying to optimize over one of those qualities might go in contradictions with the other :

* improving the quality of being easy to use by abstracting the complexity might result in lowering the quality of being easy to understand the inner system for its end users.
* improving the quality of being easily understood by breaking down the information flow might result in lowering the quality of being easy to use.

Each of these qualities is essential to fulfilling, but easy to prioritize due to the context this proposal lives in :

As the Eco Id protocols have been publicly released only a few weeks ago, there are only a few community members which fully understand how it works and what it has to offer. The priority is therefore to invest in education tools and material to increase the numbers of Eco ID advocates within the community.

The Eco ID playground ( MVP ) aim to be an education tool ( Dapp ), improving the accessibility of the Eco ID protocol by focusing over the quality of being easily understood.

The Eco ID Dapp (V1) aim to be improve the accessibility of the Eco ID protocol by focusing over the quality of being easy to use.

If the V1 will be developed from the MVP, the two versions will continue to be live and be developed independently as compare to what we can encounter in a traditional product life cycle.

The playground (MVP ) will be hosted on IPFS and not rely on centralized components, and therefore will stay and remain a fall back solution if the Eco id Dapp was to cease to function properly at any point of time.

### MVP Features&#x20;

This Dapp will cover the most basic needs to interact with the Eco ID protocol and decompose the steps of an Eco ID creation :

* Filling Attestation details
* Signature
* Attestation download
* Attestation registration and mint

This Dapp will also require its user to manually share the attestation with each other

This Dapp will interact with the Ethereum mainnet and goerli testnet to allow its user to experiment with the protocol without having to spend real ETH for gas fee.

The logic, build on stately.ai, allow its user to explore an interactive statechart while using the Dapp. This offers real support to share business logic between product and tech collaborators, facilitate collaborations and provide a reusable piece of code for any other project which would like to build on Eco ID.
