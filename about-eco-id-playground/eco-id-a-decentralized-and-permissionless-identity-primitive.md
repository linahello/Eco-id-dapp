# Eco ID: A Decentralized and Permissionless Identity Primitive

Eco IDs are primitives designed to create a fully decentralized identity system with no access rights, simple but as flexible as possible. At its core, the Eco ID system provides a common standard for assessing identity and reputation, which can be validated by verifiers and then used by any parties interested in those assessments.&#x20;

Eco IDs are non-transferable NFTs that conform to the ERC-721 standard. Each NFT contains an arbitrary assertion validated by at least one verifier and a list of the verifiers who validated the assertion. An assertion may contain any data that an individual or collective may wish to associate with an Ethereum public address.&#x20;

Identity and reputation are formed by aggregating multiple individual data points, with others being able to selectively pay attention to certain of them. Eco IDs allow such data to accumulate and thereby provide a path to a more trusted identity and reputation in the chain.
