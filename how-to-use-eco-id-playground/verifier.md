# Verifier

If you are acting as a Verifier, you need to create a new verification for your friend. To do this, ask him for the address of the wallet he would like his Eco ID to be credited to. Then go to [https://eco-id-playground.vercel.app/](https://eco-id-playground.vercel.app/), deployed on the Ethereum Mainnet (since this is happening on the mainnet, you will be linked forever), and do the following:

1\. Connect your wallet

2\. Click on Create Attestation button

3\. Enter the recipient's wallet address and expiration date with enough time for the Receiver to validate the Attestation (for example, 1 week).

5\. Download the Attestation

6\. Send it to your friend who is acting as a Receiver
