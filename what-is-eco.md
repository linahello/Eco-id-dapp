# What is Eco ?

Eco is a free-floating currency, designed to serve as a decentralized alternative to fiat currencies. It is an attempt to create new, independent money with the advantages of a payment system. &#x20;

The idea behind Eco is to take the influence of reserve fiat currencies and improve these systems with blockchain-based management that can be more transparent and fair in practice. Through the use of economic data, user input and a more direct connection between monetary policy and end users, Eco can evolve and improve faster than any other currency. Eco also views currency utility as a function of consumer expectations, network effects, and moderating, but not eliminating, the effects of currency volatility.

Finally, Eco aims to create an independent managed payment economy. It seeks to become a reliable, ubiquitous currency that will be seen as a medium of exchange and, ultimately, as an independent store of value and a global unit of account.

More simply: Eco is a money game we can actually winâ€”together.

The Eco Currency system is, effectively, a governance framework and a monetary policy toolkit with a dual-token system. It is built on Ethereum.

Eco features two tokens:&#x20;

1\. ECO is the base currency, built for saving and spending, with variable supply governed by monetary policy; the initial ECO supply was 10 billion units.

2\. ECOx is a secondary token to bootstrap system governance and capital allocation; it has a capped supply (initially 1 billion units) that is designed to decrease over time.
